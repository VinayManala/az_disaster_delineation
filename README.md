# Disaster Delineation API

Disaster Delineation API Tool as a web app uses the EONET APv3 by NASA recorded data and visualizes the data based on the real time disaster events occuring from around the world. The web app has a feature to identify the users by configuring [MSAL.JS 2.x](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/msal-browser) to login, logout, and acquire an access token for a protected resource such as the **Microsoft Graph API**. This version of the MSAL.js library uses the [authorization code flow with PKCE](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow).

**Note:** A quickstart guide covering this sample can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-v2-javascript-auth-code).

## Prerequisites

[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) must be installed to run this sample.
[Ms Azure Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/free/)

## Setup for authentication and authorisation.

1. [Register a new application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/scenario-spa-app-registration) in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com). Ensure that the application is enabled for the [authorization code flow with PKCE](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow). This will require that you redirect URI configured in the portal is of type `SPA`.
2. Open the [/app/authConfig.js](./app/authConfig.js) file and provide the required configuration values.
3. On the command line, navigate to the root of the repository, and run `npm install` to install the project dependencies via npm.

## Setup for MS Azure Maps Services

Check out the reference docs [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-maps/quick-demo-map-app)

## Running the code

1. Configure authentication and authorization parameters:
   1. Open `authConfig.js`
   2. Replace the string `"Enter_the_Application_Id_Here"` with your app/client ID on AAD Portal.
   3. Replace the string `"Enter_the_Cloud_Instance_Id_HereEnter_the_Tenant_Info_Here"` with `"https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/"` (*note*: This is for multi-tenant applications located on the global Azure cloud. For more information, see the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-v2-javascript-auth-code)).
   4. Replace the string `"Enter_the_Redirect_Uri_Here"` with the redirect uri you setup on AAD Portal.
2. Configure the parameters for calling MS Graph API:
   1. Open `graphConfig.js`.
   2. Replace the string `"Enter_the_Graph_Endpoint_Herev1.0/me"` with `"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me"`.
   3. Replace the string `"Enter_the_Graph_Endpoint_Herev1.0/me/messages"` with `"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages"`.
3. To start the sample application, run `npm start`.
4. Finally, open a browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
